            <p>When I was a kid, my dad's job hosted "take my kids to work" days. There were plenty of workshops,
                and one of them wrapped around building a web page. I don't remember much about it but how 
                cool it was to tell a computer exactly what to do with a simple code line.

                My journey picked up again when I was 13. I played a game online with friends that didn't have a name:
                seriously, it was called "Impressive Title". It had a proboards component to it and the friends I 
                made from it and I loved to code HTML and CSS. We made it a competition - and over the years, we 
                got better. I'm still friends with them today.  

                I still code to this day too and program things. I enjoy setting up websites and working on random bits
                of lines and have expanded my skills overall. It's an amazing ride so far - and I hope to continue it.
